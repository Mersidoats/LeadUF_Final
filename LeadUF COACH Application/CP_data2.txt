3,Angie Fuhr afuhrufsaufledu Staff Division of Student Affairs I am someone who was a first gen student and worked my way through college  However while it is not necessarily a positive I am still a few steps from a bachelor degree  The reason that I think that makes me unique is that I am an example and strong encourager on why it is extremely important to remain focused and complete the coursework without being sidetracked by life  I have always worked hard and have the skillset required but without the piece of paper I am limited in my career achievements  I have worked in accounting roles and management for most of my career and after 20 plus years chose to shift gears  While that can be scary it is also exciting and challenging  That experience might be able to help a student that has some uncertainty about their major andor career path to be willing to try something and work hard at it all the while understanding that they are never stuck and have the ability to explore new opportunities if that interests them Common general interests Random selection Entertainment Activities eg Reading Movies TV Physical Activities eg Sports Dancing Exercise 1 3 2 4 1 Female No
