However, while it is not necessarily a positive, I am still a few steps from a bachelor degree.  The reason that I think that makes me unique is that I am an example and strong encourager on why it is extremely important to remain focused and complete the coursework without being sidetracked by life.  I have always worked hard and have the skillset required but without the piece of paper, I am limited in my career achievements.  I have worked in accounting roles and management for most of my career and after 20 plus years, chose to shift gears.  While that can be scary, it is also exciting and challenging.  That experience might be able to help a student that has some uncertainty about their major and/or career path to be willing to try something and work hard at it all the while understanding that they are never stuck and have the ability to explore new opportunities if that interests them.",Common general interests,NA,NA,Random selection,NA,"Entertainment Activities (e.g. Reading, Movies, TV)","Physical Activities (e.g. Sports, Dancing, Exercise)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3,2,4,1,Female,NA,No,29.68400574,-82.35690308,-1

I believe that I can help LeadUF students find experiences that work for them both on and off campus. Because I work closely with student organization and campus events I can offer suggestions on ways to get involved that range from passive involvement to high-level involvement. As a Gainesville native I can help students find exciting and fun places and activities around town that will help them see beyond  what is offered on campus. \\I hope to help students in their first few years on campus find ways to become engaged and strong campus leaders!,Common general interests,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Entertainment Activities (e.g. Reading, Movies, TV)","Physical Activities (e.g. Sports, Dancing, Exercise)",NA,Volunteering,Advising a Student Organization,Dance Marathon Overall Team\Colleges Against Cancer (Relay for Life)\March of Dimes Collegiate Council\Florida Blue Key Homecoming Parade\Gator Anime (SwampCon)\Hispanic Student Association (HSA)\Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP),Lyrics for Life Foundation,NA,3,1,4,2,1,Female,NA,N/A,29.68400574,-82.35690308,-1
